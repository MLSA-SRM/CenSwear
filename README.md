## Built With:

|----------|---------|
| Python | 3.8 |
| Flask | 2.0.0 |

## Features:
* ### Profanity detection and filtering from texts 
  * The API detects and censors swear words and profanities from chat and text messages based on an internal profanity list.
  
* ### Real-time censoring of expletives
  * The web service also provides real-time redaction of swear words while emails and documents are being typed.
  
* ### Fast, accurate, reliable
  * CenSwear ensures that not one single offensive message slips through its filters, creating a safe and productive environment for the users.
  
* ### Time Saving
  * We’ve designed CenSwear in a way that helps eliminate the nuisance of having to maintain your own profanity database.
